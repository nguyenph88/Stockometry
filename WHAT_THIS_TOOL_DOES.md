That's precisely the two-stage logic the bot uses to generate its most powerful signals.

To break it down:

Historical Trend (Last 6 Days): The bot first looks at the news from the past week to establish an underlying trend or "market mood" for each sector. It's asking, "Has the news for the Technology sector been consistently positive lately?"

Today's Impact (Today's News): It then analyzes only today's news for a specific, high-impact catalystâ€”like a new regulation, a major deal, or a subsidy announcement. It asks, "Did something significant happen today that could move a sector?"

The final, high-confidence prediction comes when these two things align. For example, if the Technology sector has a positive historical trend and there's a positive impact event today, the bot flags it as a strong signal and then drills down to find the specific stocks mentioned in today's news.
