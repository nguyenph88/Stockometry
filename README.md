# Stockometry - Version 2.0.0

## Overview
Stockometry is a **two-stage financial analysis system** that combines historical trend analysis with real-time news impact assessment to generate actionable trading signals. The system analyzes 11 market sectors and provides buy/sell recommendations based on sentiment trends and current events.

## Two-Stage Analysis Logic
1. **Historical Trend Analysis** (Last 6 days): Identifies sectors with consistent positive/negative sentiment trends
2. **Today's Impact Analysis**: Evaluates today's high-impact news events and their sector implications

The final, high-confidence prediction comes when these two things align. For example, if the Technology sector has a positive historical trend and there's a positive impact event today, the bot flags it as a strong signal and then drills down to find the specific stocks mentioned in today's news.
