# Stockometry - AI-Powered Market Analysis Bot

**Version 3.0** - News-driven stock sector analysis with historical trend validation

## üéØ Tl;dr - What This Tool Does 

Stockometry uses a **two-stage analysis approach** to generate high-confidence market signals:

That's precisely the two-stage logic the bot uses to generate its most powerful signals.

To break it down:

Historical Trend (Last 6 Days): The bot first looks at the news from the past week to establish an underlying trend or "market mood" for each sector. It's asking, "Has the news for the Technology sector been consistently positive lately?"

Today's Impact (Today's News): It then analyzes only today's news for a specific, high-impact catalyst‚Äîlike a new regulation, a major deal, or a subsidy announcement. It asks, "Did something significant happen today that could move a sector?"

The final, high-confidence prediction comes when these two things align. For example, if the Technology sector has a positive historical trend and there's a positive impact event today, the bot flags it as a strong signal and then drills down to find the specific stocks mentioned in today's news.

### üìä **Stage 1: Historical Trend Analysis (Last 6 Days)**
- Analyzes news sentiment over the past week to establish underlying "market mood" for each sector
- Identifies sectors with consistent positive or negative sentiment trends
- **Question**: "Has the news for the Technology sector been consistently positive lately?"

### ‚ö° **Stage 2: Today's Impact Analysis**
- Scans today's news for high-impact catalysts (regulations, deals, subsidies, announcements)
- Looks for specific events that could move sectors in the short term
- **Question**: "Did something significant happen today that could move a sector?"

### üéØ **High-Confidence Signals**
When both stages align (e.g., positive historical trend + positive impact event today), the system generates:
- **Strong buy/sell signals** for specific sectors
- **Individual stock predictions** within those sectors
- **Complete audit trail** with source articles and sentiment scores
