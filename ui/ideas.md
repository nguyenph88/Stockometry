My suggestion is to create a "Daily Briefing" dashboard.

The design philosophy is to guide the user from a high-level summary down to the specific data points, ensuring clarity and building trust through transparency.

UI/UX Design Suggestion: The Daily Briefing Dashboard
The interface would be a single, scrollable page that presents the information in layers of increasing detail.

Section 1: The Executive Summary
This is the first thing a user sees. It's designed to give a complete overview in seconds.

UI: A clean, prominent card at the top of the page.

Content: Displays the executive_summary text from the report.

UX: Immediately answers the user's most important question: "What's the key takeaway for today?"

Section 2: High-Confidence Signals
This is the core of the dashboard, where the most actionable insights are presented.

UI: A series of large, color-coded "Signal Cards." Green for bullish, red for bearish.

Content on Card:

A clear title (e.g., HIGH-CONFIDENCE BULLISH: Technology).

A list of the Predicted Top Stock Movers (e.g., MSFT, AAPL).

A "Show Evidence" button.

UX: The user can quickly scan for the most important signals. Clicking "Show Evidence" expands the card to reveal the source_articles that led to this conclusion, with each article being a clickable link. This provides critical transparency and allows the user to audit the bot's reasoning.

Example of an Expanded Signal Card:

Section 3: Market Pulse (Supporting Evidence)
This section provides the context for the high-confidence signals, showing the user how the bot came to its conclusion.

UI: A two-column layout below the main signal cards.

Content:

Left Column (Historical Trends): Lists the historical_signals (e.g., "üìà Bullish Trend detected in Technology Sector").

Right Column (Today's Impact Events): Lists the impact_signals (e.g., "‚ö°Ô∏è Impact UP event detected in Technology Sector").

UX: This visually separates the long-term trend from the short-term catalyst, making the bot's logic intuitive. Users can see the two elements that were combined to create the high-confidence signal above.

Section 4: Raw News Feed (Data Explorer)
For users who want to dig even deeper, this section provides access to the raw data.

UI: A simple, searchable, and filterable table.

Content: Lists all the articles collected for the day, with columns for Title, Sentiment Score, and Identified Companies.

UX: This acts as an appendix. It allows power users to do their own research, search for news about a stock not featured in the signals, or simply explore the day's entire news flow.
